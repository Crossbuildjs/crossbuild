## Discord

To create a Discord bot, you'll need to head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application by using the New Application button in the top left. Give your application a name and click Create.

You should now see a page that shows information about your bot. You can add an avatar and bio for your bot here. Once you've saved your changes, click on the Bot tab on the left panel.

### Your bot's token

After you open the bot tab, you should see a blue button that says Reset Token. Click on it and confirm that you want to reset your bot's token. You should now see a new section called Token with a button that says Copy. When we ask you to paste your bot's token somewhere, this is the value that you need to put in.

Tokens are in the format similar to this one: `MTA4NjEwNTYxMDUxMDE1NTg1Nw.GNt-U8.OSHy-g-5FlfESnu3Z9MEEMJLHiRthXajiXNwiE`. If you accidentally leak your bot's token or lose it, you need to come back to this page and reset your bot's token again which will reveal the new token, invalidating all old ones.

### Adding your bot to a server

To add your bot to a server, you'll need to go to the OAuth2 tab on the left panel. Under the OAuth2 URL Generator section, select the bot scope and administrator permissions. Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser. You should see a page that allows you to select a server to add your bot to. Select a server and click Authorize.
