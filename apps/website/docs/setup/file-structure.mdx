Once your packages are installed, you can start setting up the files you will need for your bot.

For our purposes in the tutorial, you will need three things

-   The `package.json` file you created in the previous steps
-   A `.env` file
-   An index.js file
-   A `components` folder next to the files.


## The .env file

The `.env` file is where you will store your bot's token. The file should be in the same directory as your `package.json` file.
You can set it up in this structure:

```env
TOKEN=your-token-here
```

The code will then be able to access the token by using `process.env.TOKEN`.
