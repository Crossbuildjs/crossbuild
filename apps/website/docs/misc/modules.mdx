CrossBuild is built off of a modular system. This means that you can add and remove modules as you please to connect to different services for your bot.

Our in-house modules are all open source and can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/crossbuildjs/crossbuild/tree/main/packages), and anyone is able to create their own modules to use with CrossBuild.

## Module Structure

Modules, at their core, are just packages that extend a set of abstract classes that are provided by CrossBuild. These abstract classes provide a set of methods that are used to interact with the bot, and the bot will call these methods when it needs to interact with the module.

For example, the [`Channel`](/api/core/class/Channel) class has a method called `send` that is used to send a message to a channel. When the bot needs to send a message to a channel, it will call the `send` method on the channel object that is passed to it.

The module can then implement this method to send a message to the channel.

## Example

If you would like to see an example of a module, you can check out the [Guilded module](https://github.com/crossbuildjs/crossbuild/tree/main/packages/guilded), which is the module that is used to connect to [Guilded](https://guilded.gg)'s API
