Components are the building blocks of your application. Components can take the form of commands, buttons, and more.

For our bot, let's create a ping command. This command will respond with "Pong!" when the user runs it.

## Creating a Component

To create a component, we need to create a new file in the `components` folder. Let's call it `ping.js`.

```js
import { Component } from "crossbuild"

export default class Cmpt extends Component {
	constructor(client) {
		super("ping", "command", client, {
			description: "Ping the bot"
		})
	}
}
```

Every component needs to extend the `Component` class. The constructor takes 4 arguments:

-   The name of the component (such as the command's name)
-   The type of the component (such as "command")
-   The client received from the constructor
-   The options for the component such as description, permission requirements, restrictions, etc

## Adding a Handler

Now that we have our component, we need to add a handler. This handler will be called when the component is triggered.

Add this code below the constructor, but still within the class you created

```js
	public override async run(interaction, options) {
		await interaction.reply("Pong!")
	}
```

This run method will be called when the component is triggered. It takes 2 arguments:
- `interaction`: The interaction received from the component
- `options`: The options for the component
